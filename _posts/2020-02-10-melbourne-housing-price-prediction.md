## Description
The obective of the project is to analyse the Melbourne's Housing data and build a model to make predict the price of the house.
The dataset includes data for the 21 mentioned paramters for the houses in the Melbourne city.

- Suburb,Address,Rooms,Price,Method,Type,SellerG,Date,Distance,Regionname,Propertycount,Bedroom2,
Bathroom,Car,Landsize,BuildingArea,YearBuilt,CouncilArea,Lattitude,Longtitude

## Technology Used
- Predictive Modeling<br>
- Regression<br>
- Descriptive Statistics<br>

## Environment
- R Studio , R (ggplot2,dplyr,randomForest,corrplot),Tableau

## Analysis
- Data cleaning with variable research to ensure meaningful and analysable data for modelling.<br>
- Exploratory Data Analysis to analyse trends in the housing data :
<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ashishbidap#!/vizhome/Melbourne_housing/Story1">Dashboard</a> <br>
- Implemented Linear regression, Decision tree and Random forest regressor models to predict the target feature price.<br>
- Efficient features selection using stepwise selection and lasso regression. <br>
- Random Forest regressor was the best fit model with efficient R square score.
