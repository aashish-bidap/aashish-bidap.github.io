## Description
An image browsing application which, for the first time, allows an automatic sorting of images. App that sorts the Dog Images based on the image position(sideways or upright) using Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning.

Folder With Pictures : Inputs the folder path(Source) which includes the images to be sorted.<br>
Destination Folder 1 : Inputs the folder path where the sorted Upright images are saved.<br>
Destination Folder 2 : Inputs the folder path where the sorted Sideways images are saved.<br>

Upon clicking the Process,predictions for the images in the source directory are performed to identify whether the image is upright or sideways and required images are stored in their respective directories either Destination Folder 1 if upright or Destination Folder 2 if sideways.

## Technology Used
 - Convolutional Neural Network 
 - Transfer Learning        

## Environment 
 - Python (NumPy,Pandas,Tkinter,TensorFlow, Keras)
